	abstract = {The data presented here cover ∼4 decades of electroﬁshing surveys in mainland France rivers. Despite some changes in ﬁeld protocols and sampling site locations over time, the ASPE database offers a unique set of 47,869 georeferenced and standardised sampling surveys. Fish individuals are identiﬁed to species, measured and weighted. Additional information encompasses habitat features as well as “river health” assessment by two ﬁsh-based indices. Though preferentially focused on ﬁshes, the surveys also report crayﬁsh data. Numerous studies have been already published using these data, mainly on the ﬁelds of macroecology, community and/or population ecology and bioassessment. However, we believe much more knowledge can be gained from the database in ﬁelds such as population dynamics or conservation practices in the context of global change.},
